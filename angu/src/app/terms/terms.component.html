	    	<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.</p>
	    	<p><span>Scope. </span>These are the Terms of Use of TokenAsia PTE LTD, which is referred to in these Terms as “TokenAsia”, “we” or “us”. These Terms apply to any access and use of our website at https://tokenasia.com, our online services, our Android and iOS mobile apps, and any of our services related to or utilizing any of the foregoing, which we refer to in these Terms, collectively, as our Services.</p>
	    	 <p><span>Eligibility and Agreement.</span> If you use our Services, these Terms apply. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Services. You can use our Services only if you can lawfully enter into an agreement to these Terms under applicable law. If you use our Services, you agree to do so in compliance with these Terms and with applicable laws and regulations</p>
	    	  <p><span>Our Privacy Policy. </span>Our Privacy Policy is located at https://tokenasia.com/privacy. Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share your personal information.</p>
                    <p><span>Changes to These Terms. </span>We may make changes to these Terms, including when there are changes in our Services, technology, regulation and for other reasons. If we do, we will provide you notice of such changes by posting the updated Terms on our website and changing the “Last Updated” date above. Any amended Terms will become effective no earlier than 5 days after they are posted and apply prospectively to use of the Services after such changes become effective, except that changes addressing new functions of the TokenAsia Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.</p>
                    <p><span>The TokenAsia Services </span> Our Services may evolve over time. This means we may make changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice. In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services. If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via our website.</p>
                    <p><span>Bitcoin Transactions. </span>While TokenAsia cannot and does not guarantee the value of bitcoins you may choose to protect the value of your bitcoin in any supported fiat currency of your choice or simply hold your bitcoins unprotected against any fiat currency value. In the case that you choose to hold unprotected bitcoins you acknowledge and agree that the value of bitcoins is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding bitcoins involves a high risk. Additionally, the bitcoin blockchain is solely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and TokenAsia cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions, other than confirmation of the bitcoin network’s completion of a transaction. The bitcoin network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the bitcoin network via the Services, the bitcoin network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. You acknowledge and agree that TokenAsia is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated via the Services. The Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the bitcoin network. However, TokenAsia has no control over the bitcoin network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the bitcoin network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the bitcoin network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.<br/>
                    When sending bitcoin whose value is protected as fiat currency your TokenAsia Wallet converts the protected fiat value back to the equivalent bitcoin value which is then sent to the recipient per above. For any such transaction request, the associated costs (“Network Fee”) for transacting on the bitcoin network may be deducted from the requested transfer amount, in which case the cost would be specified in advance via the TokenAsia App. Upon receipt of the bitcoin the recipient may choose to protect their bitcoin in any supported fiat currency.
</p>
                    <p><span>Refunds; Reversals </span>Once a transaction has been initiated, it cannot be reversed. Purchases using a bank account, debit card, or credit card may be reversed or may be subject to a chargeback or related claim. All payment transactions processed through the Services are non-refundable. You may have additional refund or charge-back rights under your agreement with the recipient of such funds, your bank, or applicable law. You should periodically review statements from your bank, which should reflect all applicable payment transactions made using that payment method. You can also always access the record of your transactions by logging into your TokenAsia App.</p>
                    <p><span>Wallet Address and Private Key </span>When you create an account, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive bitcoins via the bitcoin network. The public key generated by the Services serves as your bitcoin wallet address, and is stored along with your phone number on the TokenAsia Service in order to identify you the network of TokenAsia users. The private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in connection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of bitcoins from or to that wallet address. The private key is stored directly in the TokenAsia Wallet app your phone. TokenAsia has no access to your private key and may not, under any circumstance, initiate a transaction using your private key on your behalf.</p>
                    <p><span>Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. </span>We retain all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and all other intellectual property rights) in our Services and all content on our Services, including our trademarks, service marks, designs, logos, URLs, and trade names that are displayed on our Service, which we refer to in these Terms, collectively, as the TokenAsia Materials.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IN RELIANCE UPON ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION EXCEPT THOSE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied terms in contracts with consumers, so some or all of the disclaimers in this section may not apply to you.</p>
                    <p><span>No Advice </span>TokenAsia is not acting and cannot act as an advisor, including as to any financial, legal, investment, insurance and/or tax matters.

                    <p><span>Limitations. </span>To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of our Services within two years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.</p>

                    <p><span>No Waiver. </span>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
                    <p><span>Assignment; Entire Agreement. </span>TokenAsia may assign these Terms to its affiliate or subsidiary, or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets.
